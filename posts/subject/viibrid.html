               Hello, I'm VIIbrid!<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I am the owner and creator of this <a href="indieviirtual">site</a> and currently responsible for the text your eyeballs
               are following. (I'm also responsible for every error made thus far, sorry.) I'm an artist whose goals are to be as independent and capable as possible;
               this website is a step forward for both; however, it is not the first.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Notable steps taken before then include my ability to edit, my transition into 3D modelling, my developing skill to compose,
               and the realization that I can also code. Each time, I never thought myself capable of doing it, let alone understanding it, but so far, my ambition to
               grow and be self-reliant has not met any serious obstacles. I do fear, however, that age and time are knocking on my door. Let's hope I prove otherwise.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In my short time on this planet, (or more accurately, my room,) I've already had <a href="history">quite the amount of
               experiences</a>, despite essentially never leaving my chair. <a href="fnaf">FNAF</a> would inspire me to always try and improve things, but it would also be
               the shared interest of the <a href="sexy-seven">Sexy Seven</a>. My group would help me develop the social skills I was missing as someone who was shunned out
               from everyone else for reasons they were never told or understood. As the group grew, so did I, and it ended up teaching me a lot of core leadership
               skills.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; However, when your abilities grow, so does your ability to perceive things. The first instance of this is with FNAF, when its
               pile of problems slowly became more and more obvious. Later on, something similar would happen with Rick & Morty, but it wasn't because of my own
               observations. While I didn't yet pick up on what the show's issues were, your mind usually does a good job of being able to tell when there's a problem.
               While it's a bad practice, those that have more experience with writing were able to fill in the gaps of my edgy, undeveloped mind. While FNAF was a case of
               being in the minority that enjoyed something poorly made and Rick & Morty was a case of being in the majority that liked it until they didn't like it,
               <a href="deadmau5">deadmau5</a> would test me by having once thoroughly enjoyed his work until I discovered the methods of his practice.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Another victim of growing expectations are my <a href="projects">projects</a>. Due to the
               quantity and magnitude of these projects, they have taken, and still will, a lot of time to flesh out and iron out certain issues. The problem with making
               ambitious projects when you're still growing as a person is that your expectations will cause the game to constantly grow with you. This has been the case
               with the older projects and may still be an on-going consequence of being a perfectionist. However, it has not yet been in vain.
