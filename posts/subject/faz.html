                    About
               </div>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As far as I can tell, this is the longest in-development <a href="fnaf">FNAF</a> fangame, which isn't something to necessarily boast
               about, but it does present my loyalty and dedication to this project. Something else to note is that this project has underwent so many revisions that one could
               separate certain stages into different games. However, at its core, you will find that, even after all these years and all these changes, it's still the same game. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Unfortunately, I cannot go into specific details about this game without risking spoilers and possible idea theft. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A chunk of this game's purpose comes from the frustration the game, and its community that I grew up with, gives me. If it wasn't for
               this project, I wouldn't be able to do any of the stuff I can do now, nor would I have stuck around the FNAF fandom anywhere near as long as I have now. Seeing
               the game I used to love fall apart and never even tap into its full potential on its own was devastating. But after defending it, and getting socially outcasted for my
               interest in the genre it created, the franchise would frustrate me enough to prove both the people that like and dislike the game wrong. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; While the <a href="2000">retro project</a> aims to destroy the preference argument, this project focuses on doing what FNAF could've
               done. This project pays attention to the small details and understands the elements that made not just the FNAF genre work, but what makes the horror genre work.
               It also recognizes the inevitable comparison to its inspiration and only alters what it needs to. Changing details that don't add anything to the world you're
               presenting can actually take away from the game you're making if you don't know what you're doing. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Like the rest, this game will be almost entirely done by myself. But this game is the reason I'm even able to do any of the stuff I can.
               From modelling, to composition, to coding. So on top of completely self-developed assets, the game will also have an <a href="faz-score">original score</a>. A lot of
               my experimental tracks have been for this game, so the tracks should be as interesting as the game itself. <p>

          </div><p>

          <div class="box">

               <div id="status" class="title">
                    Status: <div style="display:inline;color:red">On-Hold</div>
               </div>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Aside from small ideas or thoughts, this game hasn't seen serious development since
               <a href="night-at-cris">Night at Cri's</a> took centerstage. Like Cri's, it's not because a lack of compassion or interest, but instead the fact that I
               can't make 3 big games at the same time. Since the two other games have ideas unique enough to mean something outside of the FNAF fandom, it would only make
               sense to try and be the first to my own ideas before someone else takes credit for it. While that's still a concern with this game, I'm only competing with the
               remainder of a small, dying community. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; When I last left this franchise, it was still undergoing necessary rewrites. If I return to this project, it will likely
               have to be rewritten once more. Especially if this game is to have a purpose. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Like Cri's, if I find that this game no longer has a purpose, it, too, will be cancelled. I don't like cancelling things that I'm
               genuinely passionate about, and doing so would mean the death of a ton of ideas for just this game alone. I refuse to use the word "hiatus" for these projects
               because it has a connotation that seems as though I'm uninterested or giving up. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It's a few days after FNAF 3's second teaser, and the question everyone's asking is "who's in it?" No one was even certain if
               the character in both this teaser and the one in the previous one are the same. Like many, I would compare the little available to the other characters in the franchise.
               But I would actually edit them next to eachother, even if it was in MS Paint, of all programs. <p>


               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/803116832038060042/10923716_772706599470732_7218482703361569838_n.png" width="300px"/>
               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; While it's not the start of <i>game's</i> story, it's the origin of a key character in its story. Currently, it's nothing
               more than just the combination of all known Freddy characters at the time, but it would unintentionally spark the idea for something massive.<p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/803125221665931274/WP_20150122_001.jpg" width="450px"/>
               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I missed it the first time, too. The sewn lines imply more than just a simple redraw of the edit I made 4 days prior. Obviously
               inspired from the edits, the Hybrids were born on the 22nd.<p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/804032703929778176/15-01-26_OD_Email1.jpg" width="450px"/>
               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; These horrendous designs are, from what I can tell, the first versions of the Faz cast. Worse yet, this image was sent in an email
               to FNAF's creator. This would be the only time I'd have direct contact with the man, with his response being something supportive but efficient. I cannot find
               this email, and it might be due to the fact that I used my school email that got deleted after finishing high school. <p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/804034534941261904/15-05-13_OD_Foxy.jpg" width="450px"/>
               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It's around here that a lot of images go without a post to date it with. Thankfully, I still physically have the most of them, but it's
               admittedly upsetting that I can't get an honest time out of a large beginning chunk. However, judging from this, the first version of the Hybrids were a Mangle bootleg. <p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/804035000521326622/15-06-05_OD_Mangled2.jpg" width="450px"/>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Half a month later, they would enter an upright state more alike their successors.

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/804039479051812884/15-07-10_OD_Fredbears.jpg" width="450px"/>
               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Some time before this image, these characters started to have lore built up through discussions with my school friend. There wasn't much
               of value from this lore, other than the fact that it was likely the start of an edgy phase that believed unrelenting gore and death was made something scary. <p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/804040504768987248/15-07-26_FB_PF_PIC.jpg" width="300px"/>
               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This is one of the surviving pieces of evidence of older titles. Originally, "Five Nights at Freddy's 4," then, "The Fifth Generation."
               I remember realizing this was my first convincing 3-dimensional image at the time of making this.<p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/804042599131643924/15-09-05_FB_TFG.jpg" width="300px"/>
               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Then, "The Fifth and Final Generation," and finally, "The Final Generation." While this isn't the last name it recieved, for most, this
               is what the game was called. This image would also mark my transition into DeviantArt, where most of my earliest surviving works still exist. Unfortunately, not all. <p>
