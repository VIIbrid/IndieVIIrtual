               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As some of you should be able to tell, this is based on <a href="fnaf">FNAF</a>, but something more important is the style at play. The tone
               of an 80s horror comedy film, the style of a 90s future sci-fi film, and the restrictions of a 2000s game all meshed into what may be an untapped retrowave.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As of now, keypoints of this style lie in using rustic metal, bricks, and rubble. Made up of rebar, metal frames, and plating. Filled
               with pipes, wires, and rivets. Held together by platforms, beams, and truss towers. Accompanied by railings, hazard warning lines, and various signs. Clouded by smoke, dust, and
               rust. Silhouetted by cranes, smokestacks, and watertowers.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For those familiar with FNAF, the plot may feel familiar, but I can assure you that this story takes a very different direction. The contradiction
               in tone and style of FNAF's later installments would initially bug me for having a stark contrast to other elements in the same universe. I would enjoy certain elements
               sprinkled into the franchise's books, but only if they are in the context of an independent cheesy 80s flick. Within the actual context, the ideas are ridiculous and tiring.
               While the <a href="faz">other FNAF project</a> aims to prove that Scott doesn't know how to make a serious FNAF game, this project will prove that Scott cannot make
               satirical sci-fi, either.

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Still without a name, with the closest title being "Pizzerial Killers." A name is necessary before any steps are taken to publicize, or else
               I risk the possibility of this project's style being stolen from me to be used in a lower effort game made by a heartless producer with no sense of creative morality.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The <a href="2000-score">score</a> might assist in retaining the project's tone during development, but is currently nowhere near completion.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The plot was once completed, but when the project's potential grew, it needed to be revised. It is currently undergoing said revision.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Characters need designs and possible name revisions. Pete Bear, Rabbot, and Mispatch all have favorable names, but in place of Chica is
               currently "Fowl." It will need very clever and precise altering if that pun is to be used. None of the characters have completed designs, but in contrast, Fowl's
               design seems to be the furthest in completion. Pete Bear's style has to be fully realized before the design can be completed. Rabbot may need a redesign. Mispatch might
               just end up being a vast collection of unrelated segments.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Pete's Parlor has yet to be designed, but the parts that matter are already in mind.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Gameplay elements have not been thought out yet, and may prove to be a reoccuring problem of mine.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In the future year, 2000, we follow a recent high school graduate on their own and in need of a job. They would search around
               their town all day for an open position, but everything would seem filled until they happen upon "Pete's Parlor," a family restaurant with an off-putting mascot. Despite
               it being in a small town, they've never been made aware of the business' existence. A "Help Wanted!" sign on the door would further motivate the late teen to
               enter the establishment, but they would be surprised to find the place empty. On top of that, the place seemed as though it was still under construction. After
               briefly searching around for any employees or a manager, they decided the circumstance was too unsettling and it was getting too late to stay a moment longer.
               Upon returning home, they would be greeted by their impatient landlord who knew they currently had no source of income. After a brief
               argument that paralleled the several before, they would share a brief exchange with his roommate. Their roommate didn't seem to know about the pizza parlor, either.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For many reasons, this game could not exist without FNAF, so it shouldn't be a surprise that its origins stem from it. Back in late 2014,
               teasers for the game's sequel would release and bare an odd quality. For a long time, the only details anyone would pick up on is the mild industrial design and atmosphere.
               Some would realize that Scott Cawthon, FNAF's creator, used an outdated version of 3DS Max from 2013, but wouldn't note anything interesting from this detail. Some of
               Scott's personal design choices would further expand this feeling, like the 4:3 ratio, building interior, endoskeleton designs, and the fact that it was pre-rendered.<p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/801944240405872640/002_Five_Nights_at_Freddy_s_2_-_Grand_Reopening_09-11-14_fnaf2.jpg" width="450px"/>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; To really iron things out, I would have to look back at the examples from the era I was getting nostalgia for. Personally, it tapped
               into my memories of Ratchet & Clank's low-res textures and style. More up its alley was the early Fallout franchise with its color-limited pre-renders. Since it was
               prerendered, it could get past the obstacle of having to use low-poly models, but then you were restricted to flat images. For a game like FNAF, where you sit still,
               it's not a problem.<p>

               <div style="text-align:center">
                    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800387207466057758/801944543783419904/f39a9979-92b9-4273-abbd-d08520e88ee9.png" width="450px"/>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For a few years, it wouldn't go beyond just a simple observation, but in early 2020 when I was facing the issue of having an unproductive
               team, I thought letting them build off the idea would be the perfect solution. While it got the team to work without me, it only lasted a few minutes. Their inexperience
               with directing a project would cause them to instantly swerve off the path. It remained relatively dormant until I found <a href="night-at-cris">Night at Cri's</a>
               just as intimidating as the project it was made to take a break from. Just like Cri's, it would start simple, but it would soon grow as its potential shined through.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; While still trying to grasp the specifics of the style, I would look back at A Close Shave. In general, the style in the Wallace & Gromit
               series is close to what I'm going for, but has its roots in a bit more of a 50s pastel. It would urge me to explore stop motion robots in industrial films,
               like Robocop 2 and Terminator. Sci-fi model sets have a similar feeling, like the ones in Star Wars and Alien. Using Scott's other game, the Desolate Hope, I'd find that
               the other key to the style is the specific style that I've deemed "retro industrial." Games like Final Fantasy VII would do something similarly utilizing a style more
               alikened to the grittiness of Blade Runner.<p>
