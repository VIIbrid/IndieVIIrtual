               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This album will be my first officially released project. I don't have much of a developed plan for this album other than
               the fact that it will be designed to look, sound, feel, and act as my first album. Many artists suffer from a discography that starts abruptly without even
               establishing an identity (<a href="deadmau5">deadmau5</a>, <a href="daft-punk">Daft Punk</a>, and <a href="c418">C418</a>). I think it would be wiser and
               more satisfying for my released discog to have an intended and properly designed first track.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It's likely that this album will be a loosely connected compilation of my work's various tones and genres to set up
               expectations long-term, for what to expect from me in the future, and in the short-term, for those that might be listening to my chronological
               discography. The most difficult decision will definitely be what comes first; this decision will determine what many's first impression will be. Will it
               start with a bang and a beat? With a chord and a melody? With a build and texture? It's hard to say, but it will probably be what I think best represents
               the majority of my work. While I like a good beat, it's a mix of a thoughtful composition with an ambient texture that keeps me there.

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It's hard to call it "in-development" when it really hasn't started yet, but it soon should be.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I have over 13 hours of original music tracks that I've deemed worth keeping, so if I need to go back through my own discog
               and find tracks worth recreation, I can.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The musical focus currently resides with the <a href="2000-score">retro score</a>, and until the score is completed, I might
               never even touch this album.
