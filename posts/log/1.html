               After a long time of big talk, <i>it's finally here!</i><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As of right now, I'm still planning out how this website will function while adjusting for current abilities. Certain features
               that I want to develop are currently unattainable due to GitHub only supporting static websites. That's fine for now, but it will be a cause for future
               reconstruction. At least GitHub stores EVERY version of the site that I've published; it'll be fantastic when I'm far enough in to reminisce in the days
               of not fully understanding HTML or being limited to HTML and CSS files.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The icons above will one day be functional, but likely altered before then. For now, they're an easily communicated visual for
               my future goals. While it's the only one with anything on it, the <a href="../../posts">posts</a> section of this site is barely functional. Next on the list
               would be the image and audio pages, but I would have to have some form of a storage for said images and audio. For now, I'm using Discord to host a
               majority of the images, but this is likely to bite my ass in the future.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I could easily just use HTML's normal configuration for how the audio and video would embed, but if you know me, that's not
               good enough; both must have my own custom controls and user-interfacing. I didn't get this far to start relying on others and there's no way in hell I'm
               stopping now.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; College is <i>supposed</i> to be tomorrow, and if that happens, that means reduced efforts on my projects or reduced grades;
               I unfortunately cannot do both. <i>Yadda-yadda, grades matter to make sure I have a future</i>, but it's hard to turn down moments like this when my passion
               and motivation are aligned. Often, things are too frustrating to keep on going; pure moments that strike joy down to my creative core are harder and harder
               to come by. Even now, my passion has to share the constantly-shrinking room in my head with the guilt of haphazardly maintaining my real world
               responsibilities.<p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; One may likely worry about my state of mind, but I'd be like me and worry more about the possibility of being ironically
               handicapped or even murdered by unfortunate circumstance. To prepare so vigorously, then to lose, entirely, the chance to be.<p>
