               I know I've been inactive here, but I don't know how 22 days slipped from beneath me. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The complex history of the <a href="/post/subject/sexy-seven">Sexy Seven</a> became too overwhelming to cram into one post. Archiving
               and properly documenting our history could take months; months that I don't have. So it's unlikely that its history can be thoroughly and accurately filled
               out for a long time. I can provide a brief cover, but it wouldn't be as credible as I'd like. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; College hasn't been difficult or anything, but it has put me off balance. My time was spent finally watching King of the Hill
               (current S10 E4) or playing Factorio; sometimes both. Factorio recently released a demo, and since it was under my radar, I figured I'd give it a try. What
               I was not prepared for was over 30 hours of time spent playing it. After that, I bought the game and played it for an additional 48 hours. At the very least,
               it's a notable pool of inspiration for the <a href="/post/subject/2000">retro project</a>.

               </div><p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Regarding the retro project, I'm thinking about various ways to have a dedicated site for its current progress. Until then. <p>
