               I suppose it has been long enough for another one. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It's unlikely that there will be as many of these logs as there are subject matters. My life is pretty uneventful, but I do
               have a lot of things on my mind. Those things are better in the ever-updating subject section. I'll be focusing on those until I've gotten the essentials
               out of the way. At the very least, I am surprised by the amount of joy this project gives me. Never would I have thought that I'd have troubles falling
               asleep and eagerly waking up because I have programming to do. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Notable growth in my HTML/CSS department is figuring out how to have things change upon hover. Something I need is a more
               concrete understanding on the basis of website foundation before I go and litter the place. But for now, the current code doesn't hold much value, but
               the contents I've spent more time writing do. I can move the text from these posts and their respective images if I have to. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; While it will be pushed out with this post in-update, as of writing this, I still have a lot left to do in the
               <a href="faz">Faz</a> post. The post for <a href="sexy-seven">the Sexy Seven</a> will be of a similar length just due to its long history. Both the Faz
               project and the Sexy Seven go back longer than 5 years. It's unbelievable how much time has passed. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; College started and I already miss having 3+ day breaks to get back into the momentum of things. Due to a specific situation,
               as if I don't have enough of those, one of the courses dropped me so at least I have more time. But now I just feel guilty about it. <p>

               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In another turn of events, my GPU's problem was resolved. Never in my life would I have imagined such ridiculous symptoms for
               something as little as a lack of thermal paste. Easily the cheapest problem it could have had and now I feel as though I've over-dramatized the whole ordeal.
               At the very least, things have returned to normal. Here's to hoping it stays this way for a little longer this time. <p>
