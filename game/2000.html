               Currently titled "Pizzerial Killers," or just the "2000s game," this project serves as the primary focus due to the current situation presented to me. For the last 6+ years, I've been
               working on a different Five Nights at Freddy's project. This one was more serious and aimed to prove the franchise had potential, if actually done correctly. While most of the time was
               due to the fact I was still maturing and setting higher standards for myself as my abilities would continuously exceed them, a lot of ideas have developed and require a lot of momentum
               and balancing to keep the workflow steady and strong. But as it kept growing, the more difficult it became to switch between a school mindset and the project mindset.
               <p>
               Originally, the solution was a remake of a joke project called "Night at Cri's." It was meant to put aside serious writing and designs to focus on the programming aspects, instead.
               Likewise, the remake was meant to do the same. However, once it was intertwined with the Sexy Seven (a historical and close group of friends), a planned show of mine, its potential grew
               and became too valuable to just haphazardly produce. So, for real this time, we made a <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/Night_At_als/489949">game</a> in less than a week for the sole
               purpose of learning to use Gamemaker 2.0. The project didn't achieve any publicity, but it wasn't ever aiming for it. What was truly impressive was the quality of the renders that were
               all made in a span of two days. This would be the only proof of my abilities.
               <p>
               It was difficult returning to the Cri's project, and instead found it easier to finally realize an observation I made years back regarding the FNAF 2 teasers.<br>

               FNAF 2, in general, had a very odd and unique quality surrounding the whole thing. It emitted an aura that didn't seem to yet be be pinpointed. I would spend the next few years figuring
               out why it looked the way it did. It stemmed from the limited colors, the small renders, the 4:3 ratio, and the blurry detail. This and more elements would be the driving style of the
               2000s project. Given the fact that it was visually styled, it was only logical that the game would have a stylistic tone, as well. I would use this opportunity to prove that FNAF failed
               to achieve both the styles it attempted: serious and stylistic. Borrowing elements from 80s films, 90s culture, and 2000s software, I hope to achieve the definite staple of the millenia's
               end. <p>

               I cannot go indepth on the story, as it would contain massive spoilers, but despite the fact it was originally intended to be a lighter project, it has once again has mustered too much
               potential to just let waste. But like every other project I've mentioned, I value them too much to never finish. I just need the time to finish 'em.<p>
