               &emsp;While unsatisfied with my current self-given title, the name "VIIbrid" will have to do for now. I'm a multi-media artist that ranges practices
               traditional sketches, digital edits/design, 3D models, music composition, and now game/web programming. I have a complicated
               <a href = "4">history</a> on multiple sites with multiple names, but the only thing valuable is the things I've learned from
               the mistakes I've made and the experiences I've had.

          <div class = "track">

          </div><p>

          <div class = "text">
               I'm currently working on a large range of projects, with the lead example being the <a href = "https://indieviirtual.com/game/2000">retro project</a>.
               Other projects in mind are an animation based off my personal experiences with the various members of the <a href = "5">Sexy Seven</a>.<p>

               It was originally intended to kick off through a game called "Night at Cri's," but its current status is questionable. The other game that achieved
               notable development is a more serious FNAF project that has yet to gain a suitable name. It used to be called "The Final Generation," and some even
               remember it as "The Last Line," but it has grown beyond both. The project has grown a lot since then and still means a lot to me. It hasn't been
               cancelled, unintentionally making it the longest in-development FNAF fangame (since July 2015.)<p>

               Non-game projects include things like my future music discography. The current plan isn't fully fleshed out, and requires additional planning. The
               project that would have to be finished would be my first album, currently titled, "Composition Notes." It's placed at first due to the fact that the
               retro project will have an original score and a dedicated spot in my discography. I would rather have an intended first track in my discog rather than
               start out of the blue with a video game soundtrack, even if it's really good. The album would also include a cover that would help establish my identity.
               An issue is that I'm not satisfied with my current identity, and wouldn't want to have my current title attached to something that would eventually
               change. So in theory, until I've figured myself out, nothing can officially release. Other albums in the future include a vehicle-themed remix compilation
               and an album called "Wireless Chords." The plans for both are not laid out.
