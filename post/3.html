               &emsp;While unsatisfied with my current self-given title, the name "VIIbrid" will have to do for now. I'm a multi-media artist that ranges practices
               traditional sketches, digital edits/design, 3D models, music composition, and now game/web programming. I have a complicated
               <a href = "4">history</a> on multiple sites with multiple names, but the only thing valuable is the things I've learned from
               the mistakes I've made and the experiences I've had.

               <u><b>Projects</b></u>
          </div><p>

          <div class = "text">
               &emsp;I'm currently working on a large range of projects, with the lead example being the <a href = "https://indieviirtual.com/game/2000">retro project</a>.
               Other projects in mind are an animation based off my personal experiences with the various members of the <a href = "5">Sexy Seven</a>.<p>

               &emsp;It was originally intended to kick off through a game called "<b>Night at Cri's</b>," but its current status is questionable. The other game that
               achieved notable development is a more serious FNAF project that has yet to gain a suitable name. It used to be called "The Final Generation," and some
               even remember it as "The Last Line," but it has grown beyond both. The project has grown a lot since then and still means a lot to me. It hasn't been
               cancelled, unintentionally making it the longest in-development FNAF fangame (since July 2015.)<p>

               &emsp;Non-game projects include things like my future music discography. The current plan isn't fully fleshed out, and requires additional planning. The
               project that would have to be finished would be my first album, currently titled, "<b>Composition Notes</b>." Other albums in the future include a
               vehicle-themed remix compilation and an album called "<b>Wireless Chords</b>." The plans for both are not laid out.<p>

               &emsp;<b>Composition Notes</b> is intended to be first due to the fact that the retro project will have an original score and a dedicated spot in my
               discography. I would rather have an intended first track in my discog rather than start out of the blue with a video game soundtrack, even if it's really
               good. The album would also include a cover that would help establish my identity. An issue is that I'm not satisfied with my current identity, and
               wouldn't want to have my current title attached to something that would eventually change. So in theory, until I've figured myself out, nothing can
               officially release.
