               &emsp;This website serves as a very important step forward in my independence and abilities as an artist. It gives me full control over how my work is presented as well as the opportunity
               to experiment with a new form of media: a network.<p>

               &emsp;You can expect to see this site separated into dedicated sections, such as <a href = "posts">posts</a>, images, <a href = "music">music</a>, <a href = "games">games</a>, and videos.
               For now, some elements may not be present due to the fact this website will be in development as long as I'm still learning more about HTML, CSS, and eventually, JavaScript.<p>

               &emsp;This site was assisted by other reasons, like the infuriating choices made by websites like Discord or the intolerable communities of Reddit and Discord. It just seemed like making
               my own place to put my work and mind would solve a multitude of problems.<p>

               &emsp;This site is currently hosted for free using GitHub. It limits me to a 100 MB limit and forces me to use other things to host media as not to exceed this limit. At some point in the
               future, I hope to host my own server. I don't have the agreement
