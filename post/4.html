               While most would rather hide their mistakes, I think it's better to embrace and use it as an example for others to avoid. So here we are.

               &emsp;The farther back in life we go, the more difficult it is to remember things. Unfortunately, when we're younger, we don't yet understand the values
               of certain things like archiving the things you've done and the things you've made. Many of our key moments are lost to time. Mine are no different.<p>

               &emsp;A notable starting point, while silly, is still necessary to how I got here. At a young age, and with an attention attracted towards the mysticism
               of nature, I would spend a chunk of my time drawing nature. From the teeth-loaded murder-machines of the ocean, to the unstoppable destruction of the
               weather, and cats.

          </div><p>

          <div class = "text">
               &emsp;While nature was giving me a reason to practice drawing, it would take my neighbor to open my mind to original storytelling. This is the long way
               around saying that you used to play pretend with another kid your age. While our stories were stolen from the things we love, it allowed ideas to build
               and writing skills to develop, even if minimally.<p>

               &emsp;Both of my parents, to an extent, were artists, but this fact didn't really contribute anything to how I got here. Instead, the starting point
               for me was when my father introduced me to the various superhero comic books and films. I think the introduction of storytelling through pictures would
               ignite my future. The realization that I had the ability to tell whatever story I wanted with just a piece of paper and pencil would serve as the fuel
               for my motivation to create.<p>

               &emsp;The first thing I would rip off would be Batman with my not-very-subtle character, "Catman." Catman's world would also include other self-inserted
               characters in the form of my family members. The takeaway from this is that it would be my first attempt at making a comic book series. To no surprise,
               it went nowhere; a recurring theme of all my comic series. Another attempt would be done with one of the many characters my neighbor and I came up with:
               Lord Enderman.

               &emsp;His appearence should speak for itself. While I'd rather not admit, it was practically an artistic extension of myself. Not many details of this
               character matter, due to the fact none of the details surrounding it would get used. The appearence and name should be noted, however.<p>

               &emsp;For a time, the only thing I wanted in life was a computer of my own. A laptop would be the answer to that request. The first thing I'd use it for
               is Minecraft (1.4.2, at the time.) Like my neighbor, we both learned of Minecraft's presence through YouTube Let's Plays. It was the fact that we couldn't
               afford the games, or the devices to play them on, ourselves. So like every other kid with unsupervised access to YouTube, our solution was to watch
               the games we wanted to play through entertaining internet personalities like Markiplier and Tobuscus.<p>

               &emsp;These personalities would get the biggest reactions by playing horror games. And on the internet, there's no shortage of awful indie horror games
               just waiting to be recorded for children with no sense of quality. I would be one of those kids, but my digital footprint would remain relatively small
               until the release of Five Nights at Freddy's.

               &emsp;To my best ability, my memory recalls that when FNAF met YouTube, I ignored the first few videos that appeared in the related videos tab of the various
               horror games I watched. At the time, the thumbnail and title had me believe it was about a child surviving the night against evil animal plushies.
               Whenever I finally caved in, I likely watched as many playthroughs as possible. I cannot recollect too much else other than the likelihood that I
               watched a ridiculous amount of FNAF videos and drew a lot of god awful art.

               &emsp;Something I remember more clearly was when the sequel released its first teaser on <a href = "https://scottgames.com">Scott Games</a>. It was
               during my middle school lunch, and I excitedly presented it to my poor schoolmates. The teaser made it seem as though Freddy was more flesh-like. Almost
               like the children allegedly stuffed into the animatronics were actually visible. This observation, and the eerie withering, would hook me deeper.

               &emsp;During middle school, a friend would change the course of my entire life with one simple suggestion: uploading my art to DeviantArt. Posting my art
               to a public art site was something I never thought of and I would do exactly that. On October 30th, 2014, I would create my account and begin uploading
               (also now-deleted) art.<p>

               &emsp;Starting March 25th, 2015, I would spend a lot of time on a Minecraft server called CreativeCraft. It's here that I would see Shevvy's
               FNAF-themed roller coaster. I asked the guy if I could record his roller coaster and upload it to YouTube, and the now-deleted, Bandicam-watermarked video
               ended up accumulating half a million views. At some point, I would record his updated roller coaster and achieve a fraction of the previous amount. After
               that, we didn't talk for quite a long time.

               &emsp;It's difficult to sort out exactly what order certain things happened regarding the big FNAF project, but the first documented proof of existence
               is within an old Facebook post. Other than that, I'm left to try and fill in the gaps myself by piecing together specific details.<p>

               &emsp;The project started with simple, edgy ideas fueled by the idea that since my favorite FNAF fangame, <a href = "https://gamejolt.com/games/onaf/124881">
                    One Night at Flumpty's</a>, was made using drawings, I could also make a game because I can draw. At the time, I never imagined that I would
                    be able to model, compose, and program anything more complicated than the tic-tac-toe clusterfuck that is Clickteam Fusion 2.5.

               &emsp;I would spend a decent amount of time on Minecraft messing about with FNAF stuff, like making recreations of the maps only using vanilla Minecraft.
               At one point, I made a mall map that had a Freddy's location in one of the many stores. Soon I would try my hand at making a texture pack to enhance the
               recreation builds. When I finished it, I would upload it to Planet Minecraft (2015-10-13), where it became pretty popular before it got removed for
               bullshit reasons. Its popularity introduced myself to Nuke.

               &emsp;At some point, I discovered Reddit and its FNAF subreddit community. I used this network to shed more attention on my DeviantArt work. It was there

               animatronic.

          <div class = "text">
               &emsp;Nuke or Ducky would introduce me to Discord, and on April 10th, 2016, the now-deleted Enderz Chat would be created. Its members, Myst, Gold, Cobro,
                Nuke, Ducky, Shrimp, and I would jokingly label ourselves the "Sexy Seven," and just because of the basic alliteration, the name just stuck. The
               <a href = "https://indieviirtual.com/post/5">Sexy Seven</a> would be one of the most important things in my life, and I didn't even have a clue.<p>

               &emsp;Over time, the group attracted more attention; this also included unwanted attention. The group would be doxxed by a user known as MemeMachine,
               who likely just had a distaste for FNAF fans. This event affected the FNAF subreddit as well, and would be referred to as the "Hack Attack." Our server
               had a light bar-theme, and it supported my later idea of making a comic based on the events that happened. The idea of an internet personified into a
               city with landmarks and familiar faces was enough to elevate our small friend group to something a lot more special.<p>

               &emsp;It was around this time that I gave 3D modelling a shot with Blender. The first few steps were rough, but by my fourth attempt, I was getting the
               hang of things. I may not have completely understood features that would have helped immensely, but all things considered, they were an impressive start.

               &emsp;Development on the FNAF project would continue to grow as I matured, and so would the Sexy Seven's rollout. Users came, users went; lots of drama
               and lessons learned in the process. FNAF games kept releasing, and not once did I ever have a problem with it. That was until Sister Location. I had no
               problems with the teasers, nor the trailers, not even the game when I first played it (I even managed to beat pre-patched Night 4.) It took until me and
               others to realize that the game writes the last game about "Nightmare" animatronics as events in reality. For me, this was the first crack.<p>

               &emsp;The soundtrack of Sister Location inspired me to attempt making music, and so I did. I used FL Studio's demo to try out composition every now and then.
               Of course, it started with awful tracks like this one, but eventually, I got a helluva lot better at it.
